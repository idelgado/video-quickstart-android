# Video Conversations API Deprecation Notice

The Programmable Video Conversations API was supported in early releases of the Programmable Video SDKs. The API remains supported by Twilio, but has been officially deprecated in favor of the new Rooms API. We will no longer make any additional releases of this API or fix any bugs or issues associated with it. Eventually this API will be sunset entirely.

Please use the latest Video Rooms API instead found on the [master branch](https://github.com/twilio/video-quickstart-android/tree/master).
